# If statements

```shell
if [ condition ]
then
    # if the condition is true this will be evaluated
else
    # if the condition is false this will be evaluated
fi
```

- Conditions
  - Equals ➡ `-eq`
  - Not Equals ➡ `-ne`
  - Greater than ➡ `-gt`
  - Less than ➡ `-lt`
  - File availability ➡ `-f`
  - Directory availability ➡ `-d`

Example: (Refer to [if_statements.sh](../scripts/if_statements.sh))

```shell
num=100

if [ -f /LICENSE.txt ] # Checks whether the LICENSE.txt is available at the root / directory
then
    echo "LICENSE.txt is available at the / directory"
else
    echo "LICENSE.txt is unavailable at the / directory"
fi
```

Example for a small automated task.

```shell
#!/usr/bin/bash

command=/usr/bin/htop

# if [ -f $command ]
if command -v htop # This checks whether the command is available or not
then
	echo "Command Exists"
else
	echo "Command doesn't exist. Installing $command"
    sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y $command # Only available at Debian and Ubuntu systems
fi
$command
```

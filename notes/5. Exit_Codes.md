# Exit Codes

- Decides whether a command was successful or not.
- The exit codes can be visualized by using the command `$?` after using a certain command.
  Example:

```shell
user@system:~$ ls -la /etc
# Outputs the contents successfully
user@system:~$ echo $?
# Outputs 0
```

- `$?` **ALWAYS** holds the exit code of the **PREVIOUS** command.

Example:

```shell
dir=null

if [ -d $dir ]
then
    echo "Directory exists"
else
    echo "Directory doesn't exist"
fi
echo $?
```

> Above scenario outputs `0`. Because right after executing the `-d $dir`, `echo` command executes successfully which results in an exit code of 0.

- To solve the above issue we can use the `exit` command in the script.

```shell
dir=null

if [ -d $dir ]
then
    echo "Directory exists"
    exit 0
else
    echo "Directory doesn't exist"
    exit 1
fi
echo $? # This won't be executed.
```

> `echo $?` works after this without an issue.

- IDK the following approach is valid or invalid. We can also store the exit code of the previous command inside a temp variable.

```shell
dir=null

if [ -d $dir ]
then
    temp1=$?
    echo "Directory exists"
    echo $temp1
else
    temp2=$?
    echo "Directory doesn't exist"
    echo $temp2
fi
```

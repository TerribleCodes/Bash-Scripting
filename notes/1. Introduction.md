# Introduction

- The shell is the program we interact with when we type at a Unix command line prompt.
- There are multiple Unix shell programs; most common one is `bash`.

```shell
ls #It's list storage. I thought it's list items ðŸ™‚
```

```shell
echo $SHELL #Outputs the current shell working on
```

```shell
which bash #Outputs the location of the current shell
```

```shell
/bin/bash #Runs the specified shell. Here it's Bourne Again Shell
```

- Use [Nano](../assets/nano_cheatsheet.webp) or [Vim](../assets/vim_cheatsheet.jpg) as the text editor.

**Hello_World.sh**

```shell
#!/bin/bash

echo "Hello World"
```

- `#!/bin/bash` is called _she bang_, _hash bang_ or _sh bang_.
- It tells the system to use specified interpreter. In this case it's bash.

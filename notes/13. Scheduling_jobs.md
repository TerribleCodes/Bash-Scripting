# Scheduling Jobs

- For this we use a package called `at`.
- To install the package.

```shell
sudo apt update
sudo apt install at
```

- We simply create the script we want at any location. `/usr/local/bin` preffered. And if log files are generated `/var/log/` is preffered.
- Following commands can be used to run the script with `at` package at a given time.

```shell

date #To check the date
at 18:55 200622 -f /usr/local/bin/script.sh #Script will be executed at 18:55 on 2022 June 20th

```

- To check the jobs scheduled use the command `atq`.
- To stop a job use the command `atrm {job_id}`

- Associated [script](../scripts/scheduling_jobs.sh)

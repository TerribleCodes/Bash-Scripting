# Scheduling Jobs

## Using `at`

- For this we use a package called `at`.
- To install the package.

```shell
sudo apt update
sudo apt install at
```

- We simply create the script we want at any location. `/usr/local/bin` preffered. And if log files are generated `/var/log/` is preffered.
- Following commands can be used to run the script with `at` package at a given time.

```shell

date #To check the date
at 18:55 200622 -f /usr/local/bin/script.sh #Script will be executed at 18:55 on 2022 June 20th

```

- To check the jobs scheduled use the command `atq`.
- To stop a job use the command `atrm {job_id}`

- Associated [script](../scripts/scheduling_jobs.sh)

## Using `cron`

- To open a cron tab use the command `crontab -e` then choose an editor.
- At the end of the cron file, we can see a `#m h dom mon dow command`
  - m ➡ minute
  - h ➡ hour
  - dom ➡ date of the month
  - mon ➡ month
  - dow ➡ date of the week (Monday-1, Tuesday-2, Wednesday-3,...0 and 7 for sunday)
  - command ➡ command that needs to be run
- The placeholders for above variables are numbers. If a number isn't applied we can use the `*` symbol.

- For an example

```shell

# m h dom mon dow command
30 1 * * 5 /usr/local/bin/script

```

- The above script will run every `friday` at 1:30 AM

# Scripts Directory

- Here we use a common directory to store the scripts.
- Usually the scripts are stored inside the `/usr/local/bin`
- Universal Update Scripts kind of stuff can be stored here by changing its user privileges.
- By placing them inside the `/usr/local/bin` and elevating its privileges, we can execute the script directly. (No need to include the extension as wll) - Well, to execute the script, the directory must be in $PATH.
- To add a directory to the PATH use the command

```shell
export PATH=/usr/local/bin:$PATH
```

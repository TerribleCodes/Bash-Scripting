# Variables

- Declaring and using variables in a certain terminal session limits the usage of those variables to the specific session. i.e. when the terminal is closed the declared variables will be cleared.

Ex:  
`username@system:~$myVar="John Doe"`  
`username@system:~$echo $myVar`  
Once you close the terminal session, `myVar` will be cleared. (To close a terminal session simply use the command `exit`)

- To reference a variable `$` is used. Refer to the [variables.sh](../scripts/variables.sh)
- Strings can be concatinated by `tempString=$string1$String2`

```bash
name="John Doe" # There's no space around =

echo "My name is $name and System username is $USER"
echo date
```

> In the above scenario `$USER` refers to an environmental variable. They are usually uppercase and can be used without pre-defining. To see all the environmental variables use the command `env`.

# Catching Output from Commands

- The output of a Unix command can be stored in a variable by surrounding them with Backtick-` or $(...)

```shell
#!/bin/bash

var1=$(pwd)
var2=`pwd`

echo "var1 -> $var1"
echo "var2 -> $var2"
```

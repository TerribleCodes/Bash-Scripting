# Variables

- Declaring and using variables in a certain terminal session limits the usage of those variables to the specific session. i.e. when the terminal is closed the declared variables will be cleared.

Ex:  
`username@system:~$myVar="John Doe"`  
`username@system:~$echo $myVar`  
Once you close the terminal session, `myVar` will be cleared. (To close a terminal session simply use the command `exit`)

- To reference a variable `$` is used. Refer to the [variables.sh](../scripts/variables.sh)

```bash
name="John Doe"
dir=$(pwd)

echo "My name is $name and System username is $USER"
echo "I'm currently at the $dir"
echo date
```

- In the above scenario `$USER` refers to an environmental variable. They are usually uppercase and can be used without pre-defining. To see all the environmental variables use the command `env`.

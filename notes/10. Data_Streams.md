# Data Streams

- There are 3 data streams

  - Standard Input - STDIN
  - Standard Output - STDOUT
  - Standard Error - STDERR

- For an example the command `find /etc -type f` gives stderr and stdout.
  (Permission denied are considered to be stderr)
- To avoid the stderr we can redirect them to `/dev/null` which is considered as a black hole.

```shell
find /etc -type f 2> /dev/null
```

- Here number `2` stands for STDERR and `1` stands for STDOUT.
- To insert the STDERR and STDOUT into a file.

```shell
find /etc -type f 1> no_error.txt 2> error.txt
```

# Math Functions

- To perform a math operation in bash, `expr` command must be prefixed prior to the operation.

`username@system:~$expr 2 + 2`  
`username@system:~$expr 2 \* 2`

> Spaces must be included in both sides of the operand.  
> `*` is a wildcard hence `\` backslash must be used when performing the multiplication.

- Refer to [math.sh](../scripts/math.sh).
